# Finite Element Analysis of double fixed end beam
This is a repository for a FEA script used to highlight the differences between different types 
of two node elements in the analysis of a double fixed end beam under beding caused by a single load applied to its center.
Three types of FEA elements are used:
* Euler
* Shear Full
* Shear Reduced
